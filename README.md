# Project-US-Bikeshare
A mini-project that uses Python to explore bikeshare data in three of the US cities: New York City, Washington, Chicago.


## Getting Started
This project is a part of the [Programming for Data Science using Python NanoDegree Program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd104/). 

## Files
Datasets are provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider in major US cities. The three data wrangled files are:
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv

We use above files to compute a variety of descriptive statistics in the **bikeshare.py** python script.
